                       AFA Accessories

Welcome to AFA Accessories! Our mission is to provide excellent service and high-quality phone accessories.

This Python program represents a command-line interface (CLI) application for your online shopping cart named “AFA Accessories”.

Note:This code operates seamlessly within the VS Code/Pycharm platform. The compatibility and performance exhibited in the Visual Studio Code/Pycharm environment offer an enhanced development experience, ensuring that your programming tasks are executed smoothly and with precision.
     This code can also be operated within the IDLE platform. However, there are certain limitations pertaining to specific formatting and hex code recognition. While our code is optimized for general use, the IDLE platform may not support some advanced formatting and hex code interpretations that are handled in other environments or IDEs.
     We recommend testing these specific features in a more comprehensive development environment
